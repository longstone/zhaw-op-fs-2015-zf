\subsubsection{Local Decision Rules\index{Local Decision Rules}, e.g., Sequencing}
4 jobs for 1 work center may be planned according to the following possibilities:
$4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24 possibilities$

n jobs for 1 work center yields $n!$ possibilites of sequencing\index{sequencing}\\
n jobs for m work centres yields $n^m$ possibilities of sequencing.
